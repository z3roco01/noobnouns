# Noobnouns
A very simple minecraft pronoun mod.

# Usage
In game type `/pronouns set <PRONOUNS>`, replacing `<PRONOUNS>` with your pronouns and thats it ! it will appear next to your name and save automatically !

# Server Admins
If you wish to change how pronouns are displayed you can edit `config/noobnouns.conf`, setting the `formattingString` variable. It must include `%p` which will get replaced with the players set pronouns, and `%n` which will be replaced with their normal username.
