# Noobnouns
A very simple minecraft pronoun mod.

# Usage
In game type `/nouns pronouns <PRONOUNS>`, replacing `<PRONOUNS>` with your pronouns and thats it ! it will appear next to your name and save automatically ! you can do the same for your name but typing `/nouns name <NAME>`

# Server Admins
If you wish to change how pronouns are displayed you can edit `config/noobnouns.conf`, setting the `formattingString` variable. It must include `%p` which will get replaced with the players set pronouns, and `%n` which will be replaced with their normal username.
